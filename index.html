  <h1>A little about Me..</h1>
  <p>Montana grown.</p>
  <p>Portland living.</p>
  <p>I started out in Portland four years ago without a path. I came here
    to find myself and start over.
    I decided to go back to school in 2013 at PCC Sylvania.
    I saw that they had a website designing program.
    I had no experience, but have always been computer savvy and creative.
    I didn't know what to expect my first day, but finally found my niche.
    I fell in love with coding and continued until I graduated with an AAS degree.
    The last year, I found myself back in an industry I was trying to get out of before.
    So I decided to come to Epicodus and continue to follow my passion for coding!</p>
